In this section, we present a relatively complex case study, named OrderMan (Order management). The aim is to investigate how our proposed software development method is applied to develop software for a real-world problem domain. A key objective is to construct a process model of AGL from both structural and behavioral aspects that are sufficiently expressive for the domain requirements.

Figure~\ref{fig:case-study} shows the UML model Process Order expresses the OrderManâ€™s requirements. The model consists of the five essential UML activity modeling patterns (Sequential, Decisional, Forked , Joined and Merged).


In the Figure~\ref{fig:case-study-incorporate} each activity class (LHS) is attached to an activity graph that describes the behavioral logic, the developer create a set of initial unified models and associated activity graphs use Node objects, Edge objects and ModuleAct objects (RHS) to generate the software from this model.
